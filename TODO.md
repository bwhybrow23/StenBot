# TODO List for StenBot

## New Features
- [ ] Command to search and display information from popular online databases, such as IMDb or Wikipedia
- [ ] `translate` command - translate text between different languages
- [ ] Ticketing System - more advanced/intuitive than the current one

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
- [X] Fix the meme command for a new API
- [ ] Go through every reply that the bot sends and decide if it should be ephemeral or not

## Deployment
- [X] Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline - most likely with webhooks
