  <div id="legalbases">

    <h2>What legal bases do we rely on to process your personal information?</h2>

    <p class="in-short">
      <i><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</i><br>
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">
      <i><u><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></u></i><br>

      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <u><i><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></i></u><br>

    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</li><br>
      <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li><br>
      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li><br>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li><br>
      <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li><br>
      <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li><br>
      <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li><br>
      <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li><br>
      <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li><br>
      <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li><br>
      <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li><br>

    <br><u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</u><br>

    We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.<br><br>

    <u>Verification process</u><br>

    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br>

    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br>

    <br><u>Other privacy rights</u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li><br>
      <li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li><br>
      <li>You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li><br>
      <li>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</li><br>
